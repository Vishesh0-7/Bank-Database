# Bank-Database
This repository contains the design and implementation of a Bank Database Management System for A Bank. It includes an ER Model, Relational Schema, and SQL Queries for managing customers, accounts, transactions, and loans. Features include constraints for data integrity and optimized queries for efficient banking operations. 
# Features
Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model): Conceptual design representing entities, attributes, and relationships.
Relational Schema: Logical design with normalized tables, primary keys, and foreign key constraints.
SQL Implementation: Queries for creating tables, inserting sample data, and retrieving key banking insights.
Constraints & Relationships: Properly defined constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.
# Technologies Used
SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) – Database implementation and query execution.
ER Diagrams – Designed using tools like Draw.io or Lucidchart.
# Future Enhancements
Stored procedures for transaction handling.
Triggers for automated updates and consistency checks.
Performance optimizations for large-scale banking operations.
